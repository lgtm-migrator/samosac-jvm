# Probable Statements
{: .no_toc }
Samosa includes a set of features to assist in seamlessly including randomization in your programs.
You can execute (or not execute) a statement based on a given probability at runtime. You can, alternatively, specify an alternate statement to execute if a statement is not executed because of the probability factor.

**Note: Variable declarations, function definitions, and return statements cannot be probabilistically executed as of now.**
