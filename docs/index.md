_Welcome, samosa lovers!_

**Samosa is a statically-typed general purpose programming language that runs on the JVM.**

_Note: Samosa, the programming language, is named after an Indian snack called "samosa", and is pronounced as "some-o-saa" (the part "saa" is pronounced like the word "sour", but without the "r")._

Samosa is the name of the language, and `samosac` is the name of the compiler.

_A samosa playground is currently being developed to allow testing the language from the browser. Stay tuned!_

## Getting Started

### Installation

_This section will be updated soon with other alternatives for installing samosa._

#### Using a pre-built executable jar

Download the `1.0-SNAPSHOT` (current alpha release) compiler executable jar:

[Download](https://github.com/souris-dev/samosac-jvm/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha/samosac-1.0-SNAPSHOT-full.jar){: .btn .btn-purple }

You really don't need to install anything if you already have JRE (minimum java version 11) installed. Otherwise, you'll have to install that first to use the compiler and to run the programs.

For other releases, head over to [releases](https://github.com/souris-dev/samosac-jvm/releases).

You now have the compiler, yay!

#### Building from source

**Note: Ensure that you have the following installed (and in your PATH) before using the upcoming commands to build from source:**

*   **git**
*   **â‰¥ JDK 11 (the project was developed on JDK 17, but the code is compatible with java version >= 11.)**
*   **Apache Maven 3.1 or higher version**

To download the source and build it using maven, run these in the terminal of your choice:

```
git clone https://github.com/souris-dev/samosac-jvm.git
cd samosac-jvm
mvn compile
```
Then, to build the compiler jar, use (from within the project directory):

```
mvn package
```

This will create a `samosac-<version>-full.jar` in the `target` folder. This is the compiler jar.

_Easier installation methods will be provided soon._

### Usage

**Note: Ensure that you have the JRE (minimum java version 11) installed before starting this section.**

#### Compiling your program

Type your samosa program in a file, and name it something (for example samosa.samo). Then use the .jar file of the compiler to compile it **(ensure that you have java in you PATH)**:

```
java -jar samosac-<version>-full.jar samosa.samo
```

(Replace `samosac-<version>-full.jar` with the relative or absolute path to the compiler jar file, and `samosa.samo` with the relative or absolute path of the file you wrote your program in.)

_This section will be updated._

#### Running the program

As samosa compiles to JVM bytecode, a `.class` is generated, named as per your filename. So for the above example, a file named `SamosaSamo.class` would be created in the `./out` directory.

To run it, do this **(ensure that you have java in your PATH)**:

```
cd out
java SamosaSamo
```
